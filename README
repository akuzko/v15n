V15n
====

V15n stands for "VisualTranslation". It's a I18n translation tool.


How to
=======
1. Install the plugin:
  `rails plugin install git://github.com/akuzko/v15n.git`
  `rails generate v15n:install`
  this will generate assets and v15n initializer
2. Setup initializers/v15n.rb if needed
3. Include `V15n::Rails::Helper` in all controllers (and cells if you use any) you want to be translated visually.
   You can include this helper in ApplicationController for enabling v15n in all application.
4. Add `v15n` to you routes


Usage
=======
After enabling V15n, translation panel will be rendered on each page. Panel consists of:
1. Header showing your current locale. This is panel's draggable handle if you have jQuery-UI included.
2. Rendering options ('List' and 'Tree')
3. Main block: all translations that have been rendered to page by `t` method.
4. Custom Translations block. Sometimes, keys are generated dynamically, or for whatever reason not shown
   currently on page, but can hypothetically appear on page. In this case developer should add such keys
   in this block, and interpeter will be able to translate them wile viewing current page.

After panel is rendered, hover cursor over translatable content, and v15n will focus on corresponding input
field in panel. Note that all translatable string are rendered with special UTF-8 characters around them, which
are used internally by v15n.

When AJAX request is performed, v15n will accept new translations and reprocess page, as well as rerender
panel's translations, so new keys and translations will appear there.


Notes
=======
1. V15n::Rails::Helper defines t method which itself calls I18n.t with last part of key as defaul value
   if no default value is provided. For example, 'foo.bar.Hello World' will return 'Hello World' if no
   translation is found in backend
2. Client side of V15n uses jQuery for rendering and processing. Thus, you have to include one. If you also
   have jQuery-UI included, V15n panel will be draggable, which is recommended.


TODOs
=======
No tests for now :(
Any advices on best pactices of testing such things are greatly wellcomed
Any advices on 'how it actually should be done' are also greatly appreciated
